# Architecture

## Why this design

Thunderbird has no external API. Anything that wants to drive it must run *inside*
Thunderbird. The only questions are how privileged that inside code can be, and how
it talks to the outside.

Every claim below was verified against a live Thunderbird — **153.0** (Windows 11,
build `20260717002111`) when first written, **155.0** for 1.3.0 — not inferred from
documentation. See
[`docs/VERIFIED-FINDINGS.md`](VERIFIED-FINDINGS.md) for the raw probe output.

### The privilege question

| Route | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| Plain MailExtension (WebExtension) API | 250 functions, but **no** access to preferences, account/server config, filters, calendar, junk training, virtual folders, or OpenPGP. |
| WebExtension **Experiment API** (`experiment_apis`) | Runs in a sandbox with the **system principal** — full XPCOM. This is the escape hatch. |
| Marionette (`-marionette`) | Also full chrome privileges, but needs Thunderbird relaunched with a flag. |
| Reading the profile directly from Python | Fine for bulk reads when Thunderbird is closed; unsafe for writes. |

Thunderbird 153 release builds ship `MOZ_REQUIRE_SIGNING=false` and default
`extensions.experiments.enabled=true`, and `ExtensionData.canUseAPIExperiment()`
returns true when either `isPrivileged` **or** `EXPERIMENTS_ENABLED` holds. So an
**unsigned** add-on carrying `experiment_apis` loads with full privileges on a stock
release install. Confirmed at runtime: `REQUIRE_SIGNING: false`,
`EXPERIMENTS_ENABLED: true`, add-on installed with `signedState: 0` and `isActive: true`.

So: the add-on uses the official API where it exists (it is stable and well-typed) and
drops to the experiment API only for what the official API cannot reach.

### The transport question

Thunderbird cannot be given an inbound listener without embedding an HTTP server in a
privileged module (what the JavaScript reference implementation does). Instead we invert
it: **Python listens, the add-on dials out.**

Verified working from a MailExtension background page: `new WebSocket("ws://127.0.0.1:PORT")`
and `fetch("http://127.0.0.1:PORT/...")`. The default MV2 CSP does not restrict
`connect-src`, and loopback is a potentially-trustworthy origin.

The honest cost of this choice: the connection lives in the add-on's background page,
so its lifetime and reconnect behaviour are now ours to manage. A server *inside*
Thunderbird would simply be listening whenever Thunderbird is up. In practice the page
is persistent on 153–155 and stays connected. Reattaching after the daemon dies
abnormally used to be slow — measured in
[`VERIFIED-FINDINGS.md`](VERIFIED-FINDINGS.md); since 1.3.0 the add-on's transport
watchdogs reconnect within seconds, and the daemon records every attempt.

Benefits over an in-Thunderbird HTTP server:

- No port bound inside Thunderbird, no Windows Firewall listener prompt for Thunderbird.
- Works unchanged under Snap/Flatpak, where reaching *into* the sandbox is the hard part.
- Reconnect is trivial and one-directional; Thunderbird restarts heal themselves.
- No need to bundle Mozilla's MPL-2.0 `httpd.sys.mjs`.

### Process topology

Multiple MCP clients (Claude Code *and* Codex, per the project goal) must share one
Thunderbird. Since Python owns the listener, exactly one process may bind it. Hence a
**broker daemon**:

```
  Claude Code ──stdio──▶ tbmcp serve ─┐
                                      ├─local RPC─▶ tbmcp daemon ◀──WebSocket── Thunderbird add-on
  Codex CLI  ──stdio──▶ tbmcp serve ─┘              (owns the socket,            (background page
                                                     multiplexes requests)        + experiment API)
```

- `tbmcp serve` is the MCP server a client spawns. It is thin: it translates MCP tool
  calls into broker RPCs. It auto-spawns the daemon if none is running.
- `tbmcp daemon` owns the loopback listener and the single add-on connection, and
  multiplexes concurrent requests from every `serve` process.
- If Thunderbird is closed, read-only tools that can be served from the profile on disk
  keep working (`profile` backend); everything else returns a clear "Thunderbird is not
  running" error rather than hanging.

### Pairing and auth

The daemon picks a free port, then writes a connection file into the running
Thunderbird's profile, or the `profiles.ini` default if Thunderbird is closed. It
moves the file when an auto-picked default differs from the profile Thunderbird starts with:

```jsonc
// <profile>/tbmcp-bridge.json   (0600 on POSIX; ACL-restricted on Windows, see FILE-PERMISSIONS.md)
{ "version": 1, "port": 51234, "token": "<32 random bytes, base64url>", "pid": 4242 }
```

The add-on reads that file with privileged file I/O, connects, and authenticates with
the token in its first frame. The daemon rejects any connection whose token does not
match, and rejects frames from non-loopback peers. Nothing is ever bound to a
non-loopback interface.

## Repository layout

## Testing

Three layers, because no single one can see the whole chain:

- **pytest** (`tests/`) runs the Python side end to end through an in-memory MCP
  client, with the bridge replaced by a recorder (`tests/conftest.py`). It proves
  argument validation, gating, the shape of every result and the daemon's own
  protocol, and needs no Thunderbird — which is also its limit: it cannot see the
  add-on, and every 1.2.0 search defect lived there.
- **node** (`tests/js`, `node --test "tests/js/*.test.mjs"`) runs the add-on's
  real background and privileged scripts under `node:vm` against fakes of the
  WebExtension and XPCOM surfaces (`tests/js/harness.mjs`). The privileged half is
  spliced exactly as `build_xpi.py` splices it, so the sandbox rules — no DOM
  timers, a separate realm, errors that must be `ExtensionError`s — are exercised.
- **live** (`tools/smoke_live.py`, `tools/smoke_search.py`) drives a running
  Thunderbird read-only and is the only layer that sees Thunderbird's actual
  behaviour. It is not in CI; run it before a release.
