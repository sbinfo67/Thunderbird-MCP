# Thunderbird MCP

An MCP server that lets an AI agent drive the Thunderbird already running on your
machine — mail, folders, contacts, calendar, filters and settings — through
Thunderbird's own internals. Not a copy of your mailbox and not an IMAP client: the
same Thunderbird you have open.

Built for **Claude Code** and **Codex CLI**, and able to serve both at once.

## What is new in 1.3.0

- **Search works.** Every search tool in 1.2.0 was broken by six separate defects
  (reported in [#3](https://github.com/U-C4N/Thunderbird-MCP/issues/3)). `mail_search`,
  `search_global` and `search_conversation` now return results, dates, scores and
  participants, and folder scoping actually scopes.
- **Paging keeps every message.** A cursor no longer skips the rest of the page it
  stopped in.
- **Errors mean something.** No more "An unexpected error occurred": a failure says
  what to change, on every `mcp` SDK version, and a large answer no longer drops the
  connection.
- **The bridge explains itself.** `tb_status` and `tbmcp doctor` report both sides of
  the connection, name the remedy, warn when the installed add-on is older than the
  package, and point at the daemon's log.
- **Tests that see the add-on.** 111 node tests run the real add-on scripts; 288
  Python tests; CI on Windows, macOS and Linux with Python 3.11–3.14.

Details in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/U-C4N/Thunderbird-MCP
cd Thunderbird-MCP
python bootstrap.py --clients claude-code,codex
```

One command builds the environment, installs the add-on (Thunderbird restarts
once), registers the clients you name and verifies the chain. Re-running it is safe.
Agents can parse `python bootstrap.py --json` instead of the human output.

Then ask your agent something — *"what did the accountant say about VAT in June?"*,
*"archive everything from newsletters older than a month"*, *"draft a reply to the
last mail from Ali and let me read it first"*.

Prefer to register a client by hand? `tbmcp setup --print-config all` prints the
exact block for Claude Code, Codex, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Gemini CLI and
Zed. Use `python -m tbmcp serve` as the command, with an absolute interpreter path.

## What you can do

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Find** | ranked full-text search across every account, threads rebuilt across Inbox, Sent and archives, substring filters by folder, sender, date, tag |
| **Triage** | mark, tag, move, archive, file in bulk — with the source folder reported so a wrong move is reversible |
| **Write** | `mail_send` produces a reviewable draft by default; sending is a separate, confirmed step |
| **Configure** | server ports and security, identities and signatures, SMTP servers, junk handling, ~5,700 preferences — every write reports the old value so it can be undone |
| **Automate** | create, reorder and run message filters; events and tasks on the calendar |
| **Diagnose** | `tb_status`, `tb_diagnostics`, `tb_console` and `tbmcp doctor` say what is wrong and what to do |

## Safety

Reads are unrestricted. By default, anything that sends, deletes or changes configuration needs
`confirm=true`, carries `destructiveHint`, and prompts for approval on clients that
support elicitation. `mail_send` drafts unless told `mode="send"`; `dry_run_only`
previews a write; preference writes are allowlisted and credentials, proxy and
security prefs are refused at both layers. `--read-only` registers no mutating tool
at all.

To allow selected moves and folder changes without confirmation, configure
[folder rules](docs/FOLDER-RULES.md).

## Toolsets

Tools are grouped so an agent only pays context for what it uses. The default set is
`mail`, `folders`, `compose`, `search` and `admin`; add the rest with `--toolsets`.

```bash
tbmcp serve --toolsets all              # everything
tbmcp serve --toolsets +calendar        # the default set plus one
tbmcp tools --toolsets all              # list what would be registered
```

## How it works

```
  Claude Code ──stdio──▶ tbmcp serve ─┐
                                      ├─local RPC─▶ tbmcp daemon ◀══WebSocket══ add-on
  Codex CLI  ──stdio──▶ tbmcp serve ─┘              owns the socket,            inside
                                                    multiplexes clients      Thunderbird
```

Thunderbird has no external API, so an add-on runs inside it: the official
MailExtension API for mail and folders, plus a WebExtension Experiment for what that
API cannot reach (preferences, accounts, filters, calendar). Python listens on
loopback and the add-on dials out with a token from `<profile>/tbmcp-bridge.json`, so
nothing is bound inside Thunderbird and nothing leaves the machine. A small daemon
owns the one connection and shares it between clients.

More in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

## When something is wrong

Run `tbmcp doctor`. It checks every link — Python, the profile, the add-on that is
installed versus the one in this package, the daemon, the handshake from both sides —
and names the broken one with the command that fixes it.

| Symptom | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| "Thunderbird is not connected" | start Thunderbird; if it is running, `tbmcp doctor` says why the add-on has not attached |
| Thunderbird runs but never attaches, and `doctor` shows two different profiles | set `TBMCP_PROFILE` or `--profile` to the directory Thunderbird uses, then restart the daemon and MCP client |
| the add-on connects but never completes the handshake | restart Thunderbird; `doctor` shows both views and the daemon log's path |
| `doctor` warns the installed add-on is older than the package | `tbmcp refresh` |
| settings tools fail, mail tools work | the privileged half did not load → `tbmcp install-addon` |
| full-text search finds nothing | the global indexer is off (Settings → General), or `search_global` names the words the index cannot match |
| a dependency fails to load on Windows | Windows Application Control blocked a wheel; `python bootstrap.py` repairs it |

The profile is chosen from `TBMCP_PROFILE` / `--profile`, then the running Thunderbird's
`-profile` argument, then the stored Windows user variable, then the `profiles.ini` default.

`TBMCP_DEBUG=1` logs verbosely to stderr; `TBMCP_STATE_DIR` moves the daemon's
files; `tb_console` returns the add-on's `[tbmcp]` lines as a tool.

**Action log:** Every write tool call appends one line to `actions-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
in the state directory, one file per UTC day. Each entry records the time, tool,
arguments, outcome, and reply or error; replies include earlier values when
available. The log can hold private mail content. Files older than 30 days are
deleted automatically on the first write of a new day, so undo data is available
for 30 days. Copy a file elsewhere to keep it longer.

## Requirements

Thunderbird 128 or newer (verified on 155), Python 3.11–3.14, Windows, macOS or Linux
including Snap and Flatpak Thunderbird.

## Development

```bash
uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                                  # 288 tests, no Thunderbird needed
node --test "tests/js/*.test.mjs"       # 111 add-on tests under node:vm
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
python tools/check_consistency.py       # the three layers still agree
python tools/smoke_search.py            # live acceptance, against a running Thunderbird
tools\install_addon.bat                 # after addon/ changes: build, install, restart Thunderbird, doctor
tools\refresh_live.bat                  # refresh changed code, restart only when needed, doctor
```

The add-on's real scripts run under `node:vm` against fakes of the WebExtension and
XPCOM surfaces (`tests/js`), which is how the sandbox rules that broke 1.2.0's search
are now caught before a release. Everything documented here was verified against a
live Thunderbird; the measurements are in
[docs/VERIFIED-FINDINGS.md](docs/VERIFIED-FINDINGS.md).
