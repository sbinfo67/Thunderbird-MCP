"""Composing mail — the one toolset whose output leaves the machine.

Everything here defaults to a *draft*. A draft is reviewable, deletable, and costs
the user nothing; a send is none of those. The default is only overridden by the
operator (`tbmcp serve --send`), never by the model, so an agent that forgets to
think about `mode` still lands in the safe place.

The gates are the same four layers as everywhere else, but sends also carry
`OUTBOUND` annotations, which mark them destructive *and* open-world so a host that
reads annotations prompts even when its policy would otherwise auto-approve.
