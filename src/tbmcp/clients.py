"""Registering this server with the MCP clients people actually use.

Every client keeps stdio servers in a different file, under a different key, with a
different idea of what a command is. The differences that matter here are all failure
modes hit on a real Windows box:

- the command must be an **absolute path to a real executable**. Node-based clients
  spawn it with no shell, so a bare name or a `.cmd` shim dies with `spawn ENOENT`.
  Wrapping it in `cmd /c` is worse: the pipes are not inherited cleanly and a clear
  error turns into a startup timeout.
- `PYTHONUTF8` and `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` go into every per-server `env`. Codex does not
  hand its own environment to stdio servers (it assembles a fixed core set), and
  Claude Code ignores `settings.json` `env` for MCP children — so the only reliable
  channel is the server entry itself.
- Codex ignores tool annotations and `_meta`, so its config file is the only place
  the safety model can be expressed there at all; hence the approval modes below.

Writes are idempotent — read, build the wanted entry, compare, write only on a real
difference — backed up once per file and swapped in with `os.replace`. Where a config
is really JSONC (VS Code and Zed both ship theirs full of comments) we refuse to
reserialise it and print the block for the user to paste instead. Losing someone's
comments to save them one paste is not a trade worth making.
